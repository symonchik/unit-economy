# Privacy Policy for Unit Economics Add-on

**Effective Date: May 4, 2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how Content Lab LLC ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the Unit Economics Add-on ("Add-on") for Google Sheets. By installing or using the Add-on, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

The Add-on does not collect or store any personal data outside of your Google Sheets. The Add-on accesses and processes the following types of data solely within your Google Sheets environment:

- **Spreadsheet Data**: Data in your Google Sheets, such as product articles, financial metrics, and other unit economics-related information.
- **Third-Party API Data**: Data retrieved from external APIs (e.g., Wildberries API) based on your input (e.g., article IDs and dates) to populate your Google Sheets.
- **Temporary Cache**: Temporary caching of API results (e.g., Wildberries API responses) to improve performance, stored in Google Apps Script's CacheService for a limited duration (up to 1 hour).

We do not store, retain, or transfer any of your data to our servers or any third-party storage systems.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

The Add-on uses the data described above to provide the following functionality within your Google Sheets:
- Create and update spreadsheets to track unit economics metrics.
- Add daily data and generate monthly summary reports.
- Automate tasks using time-based triggers.
- Retrieve and process data from external APIs (e.g., Wildberries) to populate your spreadsheets.

All data processing occurs within your Google Sheets environment, and the results are written directly to your spreadsheets.

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

- **No External Storage**: We do not store any of your data on our servers or any external systems. All data remains in your Google Sheets, which you control.
- **Temporary Caching**: The Add-on may temporarily cache API results (e.g., Wildberries API responses) in Google Apps Script's CacheService to reduce API calls. Cached data is automatically deleted after a maximum of 1 hour and is not accessible to us.
- **Your Responsibility**: You are responsible for managing and securing your Google Sheets, including any data written by the Add-on.

## 4. Third-Party Services

The Add-on may integrate with third-party services, such as the Wildberries API, to retrieve data based on your input. These services have their own privacy policies, and you are responsible for reviewing and complying with them. We do not control or assume responsibility for the privacy practices of third-party services.

## 5. Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or disclose your data to any third parties, except as required to provide the Add-on's functionality (e.g., API calls to Wildberries). All data remains within your Google Sheets environment.

## 6. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the Add-on's functionality, including using Google Apps Script's secure environment. However, you are responsible for securing your Google account and Google Sheets, as we do not store or control your data.

## 7. Your Rights

As all data is stored in your Google Sheets, you have full control over it. You can:
- Access, edit, or delete your data directly in your Google Sheets.
- Uninstall the Add-on at any time to stop its access to your Google Sheets.

## 8. Children's Privacy

The Add-on is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated policy will be posted on our website [website](https://unit-economy.ru/) or within the Add-on. Continued use of the Add-on after changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
